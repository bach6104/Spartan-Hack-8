# Spartan-Hack-8
web description and introduction


This is a hackathon project made for spartan hack 8.

Our first intention from our first meeting would be making a blog to write about foods and dining halls in real times for MSU students to know the status of the dining hall. 

Through severous meeting, we decided to add some features to the website such as calculating the neareast dining hall for a group of friends, and using an AI bot to render the image and list out the ingredients of the food image.
